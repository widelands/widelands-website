Introduction
============

`Akismet <http://www.akismet.com>`_ is a web service for recognising spam
comments. It promises to be almost 100% effective at catching comment spam. 
They say that currently 81% of all comments submitted to them are spam.

It's designed to work with the `Wordpress Blog Tool <http://wordpress.org/>`_,
but it's not restricted to that - so this is a Python interface to the 
`Akismet API <http://akismet.com/development/api/>`_.

You'll need a `Wordpress Key <http://wordpress.com>`_ to use it. This script 
will allow you to plug akismet into any CGI script or web application, and 
there are full docs in the code. It's extremely easy to use, because the folks 
at  akismet have implemented a nice and straightforward 
{acro;REST;REpresentational State Transfer} API.

.. note::

    If possible your program should inform Akismet of false positives and false
    negatives.
    
    Informing Akismet helps makes the service more reliable. {sm;:-)}
    
    To do this, use the `submit-spam`_ and `submit-ham`_ functionality.

Most of the work is done by the `comment-check`_ function.


Downloading
-----------

You can download **akismet.py** from :

* `akismet.py <http://www.voidspace.org.uk/downloads/akismet.py>`_
* `akismet.zip (48k) <http://www.voidspace.org.uk/downloads/akismet-0.2.0.zip>`_

This contains the docs, **akismet.py**, and a test CGI called *test_akismet.py*.


apikey.txt
==========

The easiest way to use *akismet.py* is to provide the wordpress key and blog
URL in a text file called ``apikey.txt``.

This should be in the current directory when you create your ``Akismet``
instance (or call setAPIKey_ with no arguments).

The format for ``apikey.txt`` is simple (see the example one in the
distribution.

Lines that start with a ``#`` are comments. The first non-blank, non-comment
line should be the API key. The second line should be the blog URL (or 
application URL) to use.

::

    # Lines starting with '#' are comments
    # The first non-blank, non-comment, line should be your api key
    # The second your blog URL
    #
    # You can get a wordpress API key from http://wordpress.com/
    some_key
    some_blog_url


The Akismet Class
=================

The akismet_ API provides four functions. *akismet.py* gives you access to
all of these through a single class.

The four akismet functions are :

* `verify-key`_     - the ``verify_key`` method
* `comment-check`_  - the ``comment_check`` method
* `submit-spam`_   - the ``submit_spam`` method
* `submit-ham`_   - the ``submit_ham`` method

In addition to these, the Akismet class has the following user methods and
attributes :

* setAPIKey_    - method
* key           - attribute
* blog_url      - attribute


Creating an Instance
--------------------

::

    Akismet(key=None, blog_url=None, agent=None)

To use the akismet web service you *need* an API key. There are three ways of
telling the ``Akismet`` class what this is.

1) When you create a new ``Akismet`` instance you can pass in the API key and
   blog url.
2) If you don't pass in a key, it will automatically look for apikey.txt_ in
   the current directory, and attempt to load it.
3) You can set the ``key`` and ``blog_url`` Attributes manually, after creating
   your instance.


User-Agent
~~~~~~~~~~

As well as setting your key, you *ought* to pass in a string for ``Akismet`` to
create a User-Agent header with. This is the ``agent`` argument.

According to the `API docs <http://akismet.com/development/api/>`_, this ought
to be in the form : ::

    Program Name/Version

*akismet.py* adds it's version number to this, to create a User-Agent in the
form liked by akismet.

The default User-Agent (if you don't pass in a values to ``agent``) is::

    Python Interface by Fuzzyman/0.2.0 | akismet.py/0.2.0


Example 1
~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

    {+coloring}
    #example 1
    api = Akismet(api_key, url, agent='Example/0.1') 
    {-coloring}


Example 2
~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

    {+coloring}
    #example 2
    if os.path.isfile('apikey.txt'):
        api = Akismet(agent='Example/0.2') 
    
    # The key and URL are loaded from
    # 'apikey.txt'
    {-coloring}


Example 3
~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

    {+coloring}
    #example 3
    url = 'http://www.voidspace.org.uk/cgi-bin/voidspace/guestbook.py'
    api_key = '0acdfg1fr'
    if not os.path.isfile('apikey.txt'):
        api = Akismet(agent='Example/0.3') 
        api.key = api_key
        api.blog_url = url
    
    # The key and URL are set manually
    {-coloring}


setAPIKey
---------

::

    setAPIKey(key=None, blog_url=None)

Set the wordpress API key for all transactions.

If you don't specify an explicit API ``key`` and ``blog_url`` it will
attempt to load them from a file called ``apikey.txt`` in the current
directory.

This method is *usually* called automatically when you create a new ``Akismet``
instance.


Akismet Methods
---------------

These four methods equate to the four functions of the `Akismet API <http://akismet.com/development/api/>`_.


verify-key
~~~~~~~~~~

::

    verify_key()

This equates to the ``verify-key`` call against the akismet API.

It returns ``True`` if the key is valid.

The docs state that your program *ought* to call this at the start of the
transaction.

It raises ``APIKeyError`` if you have not yet set an API key.

If the connection to akismet fails, it allows the normal ``HTTPError``
or ``URLError`` to be raised. (*akismet.py* uses 
`urllib2 <http://docs.python.org/lib/module-urllib2.html>`_)


comment-check
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    comment_check(comment, data=None, build_data=True, DEBUG=False)

This is the main function in the Akismet API. It checks comments.

It returns ``True`` for spam and ``False`` for ham.

If you set ``DEBUG=True`` then it will return the text of the response,
instead of the ``True`` or ``False`` object.

It raises ``APIKeyError`` if you have not yet set an API key.

If the connection to Akismet fails then the ``HTTPError`` or
``URLError`` will be propogated.

As a minimum it requires the body of the comment. This is the
``comment`` argument.

Akismet requires some other arguments, and allows some optional ones.
The more information you give it, the more likely it is to be able to
make an accurate diagnosise.

You supply these values using a mapping object (dictionary) as the
``data`` argument.

If ``build_data`` is ``True`` (the default), then *akismet.py* will
attempt to fill in as much information as possible, using default
values where necessary. This is particularly useful for programs
running in a CGI environment. A lot of useful information
can be supplied from evironment variables (``os.environ``). See below.

You *only* need supply values for which you don't want defaults filled
in for. All values must be strings.

There are a few required values. If they are not supplied, and
defaults can't be worked out, then an ``AkismetError`` is raised.

If you set ``build_data=False`` and a required value is missing an
``AkismetError`` will also be raised.

The normal values (and defaults) are as follows :

*    'user_ip':          ``os.environ['REMOTE_ADDR']``       (*)
*    'user_agent':       ``os.environ['HTTP_USER_AGENT']``   (*)
*    'referrer':         ``os.environ.get('HTTP_REFERER', 'unknown')`` [#]_
*    'permalink':        ''
*    'comment_type':     'comment' [#]_
*    'comment_author':   ''
*    'comment_author_email': ''
*    'comment_author_url': ''
*    'SERVER_ADDR':      ``os.environ.get('SERVER_ADDR', '')``
*    'SERVER_ADMIN':     ``os.environ.get('SERVER_ADMIN', '')``
*    'SERVER_NAME':      ``os.environ.get('SERVER_NAME', '')``
*    'SERVER_PORT':      ``os.environ.get('SERVER_PORT', '')``
*    'SERVER_SIGNATURE': ``os.environ.get('SERVER_SIGNATURE', '')``
*    'SERVER_SOFTWARE':  ``os.environ.get('SERVER_SOFTWARE', '')``
*    'HTTP_ACCEPT':      ``os.environ.get('HTTP_ACCEPT', '')``

(*) Required values

You may supply as many additional **'HTTP_*'** type values as you wish.
These should correspond to the http headers sent with the request.


submit-spam
~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    submit_spam(comment, data=None, build_data=True)

This function is used to tell akismet that a comment it marked as ham,
is really spam.

It takes all the same arguments as ``comment_check``, except for
*DEBUG*.


submit-ham
~~~~~~~~~~

::

    submit_ham(self, comment, data=None, build_data=True)

This function is used to tell akismet that a comment it marked as spam,
is really ham.

It takes all the same arguments as ``comment_check``, except for
*DEBUG*.


Error Classes
=============

In the course of using *akismet.py*, there are two possible errors you could
see.


AkismetError
------------

This is for general Akismet errors. For example, if you didn't supply some of
the required information.

This error is a subclass of ``Exception``.

This error is also raised if there is a network connection error. This can happen when the Akismet
service or domain goes down temporarily.

Your code should trap this and handle it appropriately (either let the comment through or push it
onto a moderation queue).


APIKeyError
-----------

If *apikey.txt* is invalid, or you attempt to call one of the `akismet methods`_
without setting a key, you will get an ``APIKeyError``.

This error is a subclass of ``AkismetError``.


Usage Example
=============

A simple example that loads the key automatically, verifies the key, and then
checks a comment.

.. raw:: html

    {+coloring}
    api = Akismet(agent='Test Script')
    # if apikey.txt is in place,
    # the key will automatically be set
    # or you can call ``api.setAPIKey()``
    #
    if api.key is None:
        print "No 'apikey.txt' file."
    elif not api.verify_key():
        print "The API key is invalid."
    else:
        # data should be a dictionary of values
        # They can all be filled in with defaults
        # from a CGI environment
        if api.comment_check(comment, data):
            print 'This comment is spam.'
        else:
            print 'This comment is ham.'
    {-coloring}


Akismet Test CGI
================

Included in the distribution is a file called ``test_akismet.py``.

This is a simple test CGI. It needs `cgiutils <http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/recipebook.shtml#util>`_
to run.

When activated, it allows you to put a comment in and test it with akismet. It
will tell you if the comment is marked as *ham*, or *spam*.

To confirm that your setup is working; any post with **viagra-test-123** as the
name, should be marked as spam.

Obviously you will need an API key for this to work.

You can try this online at :

* `Akismet Example CGI <http://www.voidspace.org.uk/cgi-bin/akismet/test_akismet.py>`_

TODO
====

Make the timeout adjustable ?

Should we fill in a default value for permalink ?

What about automatically filling in the 'HTTP_*' values from os.environ ?


CHANGELOG
=========

2009/06/18      Version 0.2.0
-----------------------------

If 'blog' is not in the data dictionary passed to ``comment_check`` it will be
added even if ``build_data`` is False. Thanks to Mark Walling.

Fix for compatibility with Google AppEngine. Thanks to Matt King.

Added a setup.py.


2007/02/05      Version 0.1.5
-----------------------------

Fixed a typo/bug in ``submit_ham``. Thanks to Ian Ozsvald for pointing this out.

2006/12/13      Version 0.1.4
-----------------------------

Akismet now traps errors in connections. If there is a network error it raises an ``AkismetError``.

This can happen when the Akismet service or domain goes down temporarily.

Your code should trap this and handle it appropriately (either let the comment through or push it onto a moderation
queue).

2006/07/18      Version 0.1.3
-----------------------------

Add the blog url to the data. Bugfix thanks to James Bennett.

2005/12/04      Version 0.1.2

Added the ``build_data`` argument to ``comment_check``, ``submit_spam``, and
``submit_ham``.

2005/12/02      Version 0.1.1
-----------------------------

Corrected so that ham and spam are the right way round {sm;:-)}

2005/12/01      Version 0.1.0
-----------------------------

Test version.


Footnotes
=========

.. [#] Online at http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/license.shtml
.. [#] Note the spelling "referrer". This is a required value by the
    akismet api - however, referrer information is not always
    supplied by the browser or server. In fact the HTTP protocol
    forbids relying on referrer information for functionality in 
    programs.
.. [#] The `API docs <http://akismet.com/development/api/>`_ state that this value
    can be " *blank, comment, trackback, pingback, or a made up value*
    *like 'registration'* ".
