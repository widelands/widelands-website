    <h3>What deleting yourself means:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Your account will be deactivated. This means:
            <ul>
                <li>You will be immediately logged out and unable to log in again.</li>
                <li>The Username "{{ user }}" will continue to be reserved, so
                    registering again with that username will not be possible.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Your <a href="{% url 'profile_edit' %}">profile</a> will be deleted and your
            currently used avatar image will be deleted.
        </li>
        <li>
            All your <a href="{% url 'messages_inbox' %}">private messages</a> will be
            moved into the <a href="{% url 'messages_trash' %}">trash</a>.
            They will stay there until such time that the sender or recipient will also
            delete them.
        </li>
        <li>All your <a href="{% url 'notification_notices' %}">subscriptions</a> will
            be removed.
        </li>
        <li>All your <a href="{% url 'addon_settings' %}">add-on related
            subscriptions</a> will be removed.
        </li>
        <li>Your email address will be removed, so you will not receive any notification
            mails anymore.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Nothing</b> that you have posted (forum posts, comments and uploaded
            maps) will be deleted.
            Instead of your user name, the string "{{ deleted_name }}" will be shown.
        </li>
        <li>Your online gaming password will be reset.</li>
        <li>All dates given in the <a href="{% url 'scheduling_scheduling' %}">Playtime
